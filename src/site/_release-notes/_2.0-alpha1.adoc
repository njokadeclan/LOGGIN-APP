    IF THIS FILE DOESN'T HAVE A `.ftl` SUFFIX, IT IS AUTO-GENERATED, DO NOT EDIT IT!

    Version-specific release notes (`7.8.0.adoc`, etc.) are generated from `src/changelog/*/.release-notes.adoc.ftl`.
    Auto-generation happens during `generate-sources` phase of Maven.
    Hence, you must always

    1. Find and edit the associated `.release-notes.adoc.ftl`
    2. Run `./mvnw generate-sources`
    3. Commit both `.release-notes.adoc.ftl` and the generated `7.8.0.adoc`

[#release-notes-2-0-alpha1]
== 2.0-alpha1

Release date:: 2012-07-29


[#release-notes-2-0-alpha1-added]
=== Added

* Added ability to filter on the AppenderRef by adding either a level or a filter. (https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/LOG4J2-60[LOG4J2-60])

[#release-notes-2-0-alpha1-fixed]
=== Fixed

* Make sure all application facing log methods use their own FQCN. This patch resolves a unit test failure for the %C pattern when using the Category logger. (https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/LOG4J2-50[LOG4J2-50])
* Remove LoggerContext support for custom logger factories. All Loggers returned by LoggerContext should be compatible and of the same type. (https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/LOG4J2-51[LOG4J2-51])
* Level.toLevel would throw an IllegalArgumentException instead of returning the default value. (https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/LOG4J2-56[LOG4J2-56])
