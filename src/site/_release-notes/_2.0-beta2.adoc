    IF THIS FILE DOESN'T HAVE A `.ftl` SUFFIX, IT IS AUTO-GENERATED, DO NOT EDIT IT!

    Version-specific release notes (`7.8.0.adoc`, etc.) are generated from `src/changelog/*/.release-notes.adoc.ftl`.
    Auto-generation happens during `generate-sources` phase of Maven.
    Hence, you must always

    1. Find and edit the associated `.release-notes.adoc.ftl`
    2. Run `./mvnw generate-sources`
    3. Commit both `.release-notes.adoc.ftl` and the generated `7.8.0.adoc`

[#release-notes-2-0-beta2]
== 2.0-beta2

Release date:: 2012-10-07


[#release-notes-2-0-beta2-added]
=== Added

* Add getFormats to MultiformatMessage and allow StructuredDataMessage to format as XML.
* Add support for ANSI colors by adding the highlight and style pattern converters. Fix pattern parsing to allow nested patterns.
* Allow the status logging to be directed to stderr or to a file.
* Add interval and modulate options to TimeBasedTriggeringPolicy to allow more fine-grained control of when file rolling should occur. (https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/LOG4J2-35[LOG4J2-35])
* Add support for filtering packages from stack traces. (https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/LOG4J2-58[LOG4J2-58])
* If system property "disableThreadContextMap" is set puts to the ThreadContext will be ignored. If system property "disableThreadContext" is set both puts and pushes will be ignored. (https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/LOG4J2-83[LOG4J2-83])
* If system property "disableThreadContextStack" is set pushes to the ThreadContext will be ignored. If system property "disableThreadContext" is set both puts and pushes will be ignored. (https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/LOG4J2-84[LOG4J2-84])

[#release-notes-2-0-beta2-changed]
=== Changed

* Made ParameterizedMessage, StringFormattedMessage and ThreadDumpMessage immutable. LocalizedMessage is immutable except that it will be updated with the logger name when it is added to the LogEvent.

[#release-notes-2-0-beta2-fixed]
=== Fixed

* DefaultConfiguration was not starting the Console Appender.
* If the ThreadContext map is empty the LogEvent will contain a null value to reduce the overhead of creating log events and in the size of the serialized object. (https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/LOG4J2-83[LOG4J2-83])
* If the ThreadContext stack is empty the LogEvent will contain a null value to reduce the overhead of creating log events and in the size of the serialized object. Changed the ThreadContext stack to use a custom stack interface instead of java.util.Stack as that class is overly heavy. This change will cause an API incompatibility. (https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/LOG4J2-84[LOG4J2-84])
* Many logging methods in AbstractLogger were set to an incorrect logging level. catching was using the THROWING marker and was set to debug instead of error. (https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/LOG4J2-88[LOG4J2-88])
* Add documentation on client vs server mode to performance page. (https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/LOG4J2-90[LOG4J2-90])
* Log4j 1.2 adapter's Category class was missing 3 log methods. (https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/LOG4J2-91[LOG4J2-91])
* Converted DynamicThresholdFilter to use KeyValuePair. Fixed bugs in the Map-based filters to allow declaration of multiple values for a key to match the documentation. (https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/LOG4J2-92[LOG4J2-92])
* Move variable substitution from PatternLayout to appropriate converters to improve performance.
