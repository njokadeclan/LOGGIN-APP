    Version-specific release notes (`7.8.0.adoc`, etc.) are generated from `src/changelog/*/.release-notes.adoc.ftl`.
    Auto-generation happens during `generate-sources` phase of Maven.
    Hence, you must always

    1. Find and edit the associated `.release-notes.adoc.ftl`
    2. Run `./mvnw generate-sources`
    3. Commit both `.release-notes.adoc.ftl` and the generated `7.8.0.adoc`

[#release-notes-2-0-beta9-changed]
=== Changed

* Changed the (relatively new) PatternLayout configuration attribute "suppressExceptions" to "alwaysWriteExceptions" to more correctly indicate what it does. As such, the meaning of this attribute has reversed (previous "true"s should become "false"s, and vice versa). Since this was an undocumented attribute up until now, it's unlikely this change will affect any users.
* Changed the "suppressExceptions" configuration attribute for all Appenders to "ignoreExceptions" to avoid confusion with Java 7 suppressed exceptions. Also renamed the Appender#isExceptionSuppressed() method to Appender#ignoreExceptions() to avoid the same confusion. All Appenders by default internally log and then ignore exceptions encountered while logging. Setting "ignoreExceptions" to "false" on an Appender causes it to allow exceptions to propagate to the caller. You must set "ignoreExceptions" to "false" for Appenders you are wrapping in the Failover Appender.
* Cleaned up tests and cleared up documentation for the JPA appender following the resolution of EclipseLink issue #412454.
* Improved site by adding quick jump-off page and menu for Javadoc links for all components.
* Update JSON Jackson library to 2.2.2 from 2.2.1. (https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/LOG4J2-306[LOG4J2-306])
* Updated Async Loggers' LMAX Disruptor library from 3.0.1 to 3.2.0. (https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/LOG4J2-307[LOG4J2-307])
* Clarified which library versions were used in Async Loggers performance test. (https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/LOG4J2-308[LOG4J2-308])
* XML layout improvements (compact vs. pretty, namespace, namespace prefix, root element). (https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/LOG4J2-312[LOG4J2-312])
* Renamed FastFileAppender and FastRollingFileAppender to RandomAccessFileAppender and RollingRandomAccessFileAppender. Configurations using the Fast(Rolling)File element no longer work and should be modified to use the (Rolling)RandomAccessFile element. (https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/LOG4J2-317[LOG4J2-317])
* Allow shutdown hook to be disabled in the configuration. (https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/LOG4J2-318[LOG4J2-318])
* Update JDBC tests to use H2 database 1.3.173 from 1.3.172. (https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/LOG4J2-325[LOG4J2-325])

* Update commons-logging to 1.1.3 from 1.1.1. (https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/LOG4J2-366[LOG4J2-366])
* Update Jackson dependency to 1.9.13 from 1.9.11. (https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/LOG4J2-387[LOG4J2-387])
* Update Java Mail dependency to 1.5.0 from 1.4.7. (https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/LOG4J2-388[LOG4J2-388])
