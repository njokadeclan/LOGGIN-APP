[#release-notes-2-11-0]
== 2.11.0

Release date:: 2018-03-11

This release contains new features, bugfixes and minor enhancements.
Some of the new features include support for the Java 9 module system, support for the new SLF4j 1.8 binding mechanism, simplification of the Log4j property naming scheme, and native support of Jetty's logger.
Log4j API is now a fully compliant module while the other Log4j jars are named automatic modules.

As of Log4j 2.9.0, the Log4j API was modified to use `java.util.ServiceLoader` to locate Log4j implementations, although the former binding mechanism is still supported.
The Log4j API JAR is now a multi-release JAR to provide implementations of Java 9 specific classes.
Multi-release JARs are not supported by the OSGi specification so OSGi modules will not be able to take advantage of these implementations but will not lose functionality as they will fall back to the implementations used in Java 7 and 8.
More details on the new features and fixes are itemized below.
Note that some tools are not compatible with multi-release JARs and may fail trying to process class files in the `META-INF/versions/9` folder.
Those errors should be reported to the tool vendor.

Note that subsequent to the 2.9.0 release, for security reasons, `SerializedLayout` is deprecated and no longer used as default in the Socket and JMS appenders.
`SerializedLayout` can still be used as before, but has to be specified explicitly.
To retain old behaviour, you have to change configuration like:

[source,xml]
----
<Appenders>
  <Socket name="socket" host="localhost" port="9500"/>
</Appenders>
----

into:

[source,xml]
----
<Appenders>
  <Socket name="socket" host="localhost" port="9500">
    <SerializedLayout/>
  </Socket>
</Appenders>
----

We do, however, discourage the use of `SerializedLayout` and recommend `JsonLayout` as a replacement:

[source,xml]
----
<Appenders>
  <Socket name="socket" host="localhost" port="9500">
    <JsonLayout properties="true"/>
  </Socket>
</Appenders>
----

Note that subsequent to the 2.9.0 release, for security reasons, Log4j does not process DTD in XML files.
If you used DTD for including snippets, you have to use XInclude or Composite Configuration instead.

The Log4j 2.11.0 API, as well as many core components, maintains binary compatibility with previous releases with the following exceptions to Log4j Core.
Log4j 2.11.0 moves code from `log4j-core` to several new Maven modules.
Dependencies to other JARs that used to be optional in `log4j-core` are now required in the new modules.
The code in these modules have been repackaged.
These changes do not affect your configuration files.

The new modules are:

`log4j-jdbc-dbc2`::
* Group ID: `org.apache.logging.log4j
* Artifact ID: `log4j-jdbc-dbc2`
* Old package: `org.apache.logging.log4j.core.appender.db.jdbc`
* New package: `org.apache.logging.log4j.jdbc.appender`

`log4j-jpa`::
* Group ID: `org.apache.logging.log4j`
* Artifact ID: `log4j-jpa`
* Old package 1: `org.apache.logging.log4j.core.appender.db.jpa`
* New package 1: `org.apache.logging.log4j.jpa.appender`
* Old package 2: `org.apache.logging.log4j.core.appender.db.jpa.converter`
* New package 2: `org.apache.logging.log4j.jpa.converter`

`log4j-mongodb2`::
* Group ID: `org.apache.logging.log4j`
* Artifact ID: `log4j-mongodb2`
* Old package: `org.apache.logging.log4j.mongodb`
* New package: `org.apache.logging.log4j.mongodb2`

`log4j-mongodb3`::
* Group ID: `org.apache.logging.log4j`
* Artifact ID: `log4j-mongodb3`
* Old package: `org.apache.logging.log4j.mongodb`
* New package: `org.apache.logging.log4j.mongodb3`

Log4j 2.11.0 requires a minimum of Java 7 to build and run.
Log4j 2.3 was the last release that supported Java 6.

Basic compatibility with Log4j 1.x is provided through the `log4j-1.2-api` component, however it does
not implement some of the very implementation specific classes and methods.
The package names and Maven `groupId` have been changed to `org.apache.logging.log4j` to avoid any conflicts with Log4j 1.x.

For complete information on Apache Log4j 2, including instructions on how to submit bug reports, patches, or suggestions for improvement, see http://logging.apache.org/log4j/2.x/[the Apache Log4j 2 website].
