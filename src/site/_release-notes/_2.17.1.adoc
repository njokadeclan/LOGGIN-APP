    Version-specific release notes (`7.8.0.adoc`, etc.) are generated from `src/changelog/*/.release-notes.adoc.ftl`.
    Auto-generation happens during `generate-sources` phase of Maven.
    Hence, you must always

    1. Find and edit the associated `.release-notes.adoc.ftl`
    2. Run `./mvnw generate-sources`
    3. Commit both `.release-notes.adoc.ftl` and the generated `7.8.0.adoc`

[#release-notes-2-17-1]
== 2.17.1

Release date:: 2021-12-27

This release addresses CVE-2021-44832 and contains other minor fixes.

Due to a break in compatibility in the SLF4J binding, Log4j now ships with two versions of the SLF4J to Log4j adapters.
`log4j-slf4j-impl` should be used with SLF4J 1.7.x and earlier and `log4j-slf4j18-impl` should be used with SLF4J 1.8.x and later.
SLF4J-2.0.0 alpha releases are not fully supported.
See https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/LOG4J2-2975[LOG4J2-2975] and https://jira.qos.ch/browse/SLF4J-511[SLF4J-511].

The Log4j 2.17.1 API, as well as many core components, maintains binary compatibility with previous releases.

Apache Log4j 2.17.1 requires a minimum of Java 8 to build and run.
Log4j 2.12.2 is the last release to support Java 7.
Java 7 is no longer supported by the Log4j team.

For complete information on Apache Log4j 2, including instructions on how to submit bug reports, patches, or suggestions for improvement, see http://logging.apache.org/log4j/2.x/[the Apache Log4j 2 website].
