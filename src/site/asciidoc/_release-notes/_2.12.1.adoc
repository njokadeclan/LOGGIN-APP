    Version-specific release notes (`7.8.0.adoc`, etc.) are generated from `src/changelog/*/.release-notes.adoc.ftl`.
    Auto-generation happens during `generate-sources` phase of Maven.
    Hence, you must always

    1. Find and edit the associated `.release-notes.adoc.ftl`
    2. Run `./mvnw generate-sources`
    3. Commit both `.release-notes.adoc.ftl` and the generated `7.8.0.adoc`

[#release-notes-2-12-1]
== 2.12.1

Release date:: 2019-08-06

This release contains bugfixes and minor enhancements.

This release improves the performance of capturing location information, makes `log4j-core` optional in the log4j 1.2 bridge, and explicitly removes `LoggerContext` references from components that keep track of them when the LoggerContext is shut down.
More details on the new features and fixes are itemized below.

Due to a break in compatibility in the SLF4J binding, Log4j now ships with two versions of the SLF4J to Log4j adapters.
`log4j-slf4j-impl` should be used with SLF4J 1.7.x and earlier and `log4j-slf4j18-impl` should be used with SLF4J 1.8.x and later.

Note that the XML, JSON and YAML formats changed in the 2.11.0 release: they no longer have the `timeMillis` attribute and instead have an `Instant` element with `epochSecond` and `nanoOfSecond` attributes.

The Log4j 2.12.1 API, as well as many core components, maintains binary compatibility with previous releases.

Log4j 2.12.1 requires a minimum of Java 8 to build and run.
Log4j 2.3 was the last release that supported Java 6 and Log4j 2.11.2 is the last release to support Java 7.

Basic compatibility with Log4j 1.x is provided through the `log4j-1.2-api` component, however it does
not implement some of the very implementation specific classes and methods.
The package names and Maven `groupId` have been changed to `org.apache.logging.log4j` to avoid any conflicts with Log4j 1.x.

For complete information on Apache Log4j 2, including instructions on how to submit bug reports, patches, or suggestions for improvement, see http://logging.apache.org/log4j/2.x/[the Apache Log4j 2 website].
