[#release-notes-2-17-2]
== 2.17.2

Release date:: 2022-02-23

This release contains the changes noted below:

* Over 50 improvements and fixes to the Log4j 1.x support.
Continued testing has shown it is a suitable replacement for Log4j 1.x in most cases.
* Scripting now requires a system property be specified naming the languages the user wishes to allow.
The scripting engine will not load if the property isn't set.
* By default, the only remote protocol allowed for loading configuration files is HTTPS.
Users can specify a system property to allow others or prevent remote loading entirely.
* Variable resolution has been modified so that only properties defined as properties in the configuration file can be recursive.
All other Lookups are now non-recursive.
This addresses issues users were having resolving lookups specified in property definitions for use in the `RoutingAppender` and `RollingFileAppender` due to restrictions put in place in 2.17.1.
* Many other fixes and improvements.

Due to a break in compatibility in the SLF4J binding, Log4j now ships with two versions of the SLF4J to Log4j adapters.
`log4j-slf4j-impl` should be used with SLF4J 1.7.x and earlier and `log4j-slf4j18-impl` should be used with SLF4J 1.8.x and later.
SLF4J-2.0.0 alpha releases are not fully supported.
See https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/LOG4J2-2975[LOG4J2-2975] and https://jira.qos.ch/browse/SLF4J-511[SLF4J-511].

The Log4j 2.17.2 API, as well as many core components, maintains binary compatibility with previous releases.

Apache Log4j 2.17.2 requires a minimum of Java 8 to build and run.
Log4j 2.12.4 is the last release to support Java 7.
Log4j 2.3.2 is the last release to support Java 6.
Java 6 and Java 7 are no longer supported by the Log4j team.

For complete information on Apache Log4j 2, including instructions on how to submit bug reports, patches, or suggestions for improvement, see http://logging.apache.org/log4j/2.x/[the Apache Log4j 2 website].
