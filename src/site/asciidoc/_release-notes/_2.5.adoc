[#release-notes-2-5]
== 2.5

Release date:: 2015-12-06

This is the ninth GA release.
It contains several bugfixes and new features.
The new features include the ability to specify delete actions during file rollover, a CRON-based
triggering policy for file rollover, support for JSR 223 scripts in filters, pattern selectors and delete actions, and a policy for removing idle appenders from the `RoutingAppender`.
More details on the features and bugfixes are itemized below.

Log4j 2.5 requires a minimum of Java 7 to build and run.
Log4j 2.3 was the last release that supported Java 6.

Basic compatibility with Log4j 1.x is provided through the `log4j-1.2-api` component, however it does
not implement some of the very implementation specific classes and methods.
The package names and Maven `groupId` have been changed to `org.apache.logging.log4j` to avoid any conflicts with Log4j 1.x.

For complete information on Apache Log4j 2, including instructions on how to submit bug reports, patches, or suggestions for improvement, see http://logging.apache.org/log4j/2.x/[the Apache Log4j 2 website].

* Remove ConfigurationMonitor. The WatchManager is now used to check for configuration changes. (https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/LOG4J2-1202[LOG4J2-1202])
* Update kafka-clients from 0.8.2.2 to 0.9.0.0. (https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/LOG4J2-1207[LOG4J2-1207])
* Add PurgePolicy and IdlePurgePolicy to RoutingAppender. (https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/LOG4J2-649[LOG4J2-649])

=== Fixed

* Performance improvement when gathering location information. (https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/LOG4J2-1029[LOG4J2-1029])
* Web site corrections and updates. (https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/LOG4J2-1156[LOG4J2-1156])
* Fix compilation error for classes annotated with @Plugin. (https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/LOG4J2-1157[LOG4J2-1157])
* Log4J JUL adapter is using MessageFormat on String passed by java.util.function.Supplier<String>. (https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/LOG4J2-1158[LOG4J2-1158])
* Fixed a ThreadLocal memory leak in Tomcat8 that mentions AsyncLoggers when Async Loggers are not used. (https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/LOG4J2-1159[LOG4J2-1159])
* Improve Log4j initialization status messages. (https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/LOG4J2-1165[LOG4J2-1165])
* AbstractConfiguration executor should use a DaemonThreadFactory. (https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/LOG4J2-1166[LOG4J2-1166])
* Use servlet context name for logger context name when available. (https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/LOG4J2-1171[LOG4J2-1171])
* Fixed ThreadLocal leak [AsyncLogger$Info] on Tomcat when using AsyncLoggerContextSelector. (https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/LOG4J2-1172[LOG4J2-1172])
* Fixed rollover error when copying to a directory mapped to a remote Linux host. (https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/LOG4J2-1173[LOG4J2-1173])
* Fixed memory leak when log4j jars are in Tomcat's lib folder. (https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/LOG4J2-1176[LOG4J2-1176])
* Logger cache does not account for message factory. (https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/LOG4J2-1180[LOG4J2-1180])
* Prefix all thread names Log4j creates with "Log4j2-". (https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/LOG4J2-1193[LOG4J2-1193])

* MongoDbConnection does not close MongoClient. (https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/LOG4J2-1196[LOG4J2-1196])
* Better web app support for async loggers: Fixed a memory leak that occurred when the logging jars are placed in the container's classpath and the configuration file uses AsyncRoot/AsyncLogger. The problem was that the first web application started the Disruptor background thread [AsyncLoggerConfig-1] but did not stop it until all web apps are stopped. Each web application now has its own Disruptor which is stopped/started together with the web app. (https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/LOG4J2-323[LOG4J2-323])
* Reduced memory usage of status messages in bounded queue; support zero-length queue that stores no messages. (https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/LOG4J2-324[LOG4J2-324])
* Allow triggering policy and rollover strategy to be modified during reconfiguration. (https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/LOG4J2-381[LOG4J2-381])
* Better web app support for async loggers: it is now possible to place the logging jars in the container's classpath when making all loggers asynchronous by using AsyncLoggerContextSelector. This fixes a problem where logging would stop working after stopping and restarting a web application. (https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/LOG4J2-493[LOG4J2-493])
* org.apache.logging.log4j.core.Logger should be serializable. (https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/LOG4J2-801[LOG4J2-801])
* Fixed bug where omitting the <display-name> element in web.xml caused incorrect log4j initialization, resulting in memory leaks when the web application was stopped or reloaded. (https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/LOG4J2-873[LOG4J2-873])
* Documentation: fixed minor issues with the site and manual pages. (https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/LOG4J2-879[LOG4J2-879])
* Fix plugin documentation error about Converters. (https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/LOG4J2-948[LOG4J2-948])
* RollingFileAppender should also roll over when log event time is equal to rollover time, not only when later. (https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/LOG4J2-999[LOG4J2-999])
